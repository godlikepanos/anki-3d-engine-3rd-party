When copying the lua dont copy the 2 .c files that contain the main. you don't 
need those (lua.c and luac.c)

Put the following to make it build on Android if needed:
#ifndef getlocaledecpoin
#define getlocaledecpoint() ('.') 
#endif

The LUA source code contains some additional AnKi code. See for user_data in
lua_State structure, lua_setuserdata and lua_getuserdata
